# Stratus User Guidelines

## Intended use

Stratus VMs are intended to provide a public health bioinformatics compute infrastructure for state public health labs (PHLs) which do not have access to such a resource within their laboratory. The service is provided at no cost to regional PHLs and technical support is provided by the CDC AMD Central Region Bioinformatics Regional Resource.
Stratus VMs are intended to be used for processing and analysis of public sequencing data from pathogens of public health importance. As such, some types of data used in public health labs are not appropriate for analysis on Stratus.

## Guidelines

- Users will not access or upload non-public data to Stratus VMs.
  - Examples of non-public data include, but are not limited to, protected health information, personally identifiable information, and information from metagenomics studies which contain human sequence data.
- Users will only use the Stratus VM for activities related to their work in public health.
- Users will not use the Stratus VM for long term storage of data.
  - Stratus VM storage is limited and non-redundant. While we strive to provide a reliable resource, we make no guarantees about data integrity or Stratus VM uptime.
