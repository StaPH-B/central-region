# Changing the password on your Stratus VM

For security reasons, it is important to change the password on the stateuser account of your Stratus VM as soon as possible.

First, [login to a remote desktop session on your VM](stratus.html). Then, open the terminal by double clicking the icon on your desktop.

Once the terminal window appears enter the command `passwd` and follow the on-screen prompts to enter your current password and your new password.

**Note: letters will not appear as you type your password, this is normal**
